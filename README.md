# Arch Linux metapackages

A set of meta-packages for simplifying a system install.

This is really simple. There's nothing but meta packages here.

You can of course just do a `makepkg -si` in each of these packages
to install them.  Or you can clone my [Arch-Setup](http://github.com/ericgebhart/Arch-Setup) 
repo and get a script to install these along with other things that will make the configurations
more complete.
